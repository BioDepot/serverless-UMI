# Rapid RNA sequencing data analysis using serverless computing

This repository contains software and instructions to run a serverless RNA-seq  UMI pipeline described in [Accessible and interactive RNA sequencing analysis using serverless computing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/576199v2)

The executable graphical front-end for the serverless workflows is found in the [Biodepot-workflow builder subdirectory](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/tree/master/Biodepot-workflow-builder). A [README file](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/tree/master/Biodepot-workflow-builder/README.md) in the subdirectory gives instructions on how to run the software. A 7 minute youtube video is available: [here](https://youtu.be/WHb_lQv3Y8Y)


Code used to benchmark the AWS and Google code are in the corresponding subdirectories.

To run these workflows, the user must have an AWS or GCP account and obtain a set of key pairs for authentication. Instructions on how to obtain these credentails follow:

- AWS Platform
  - [Create AWS Account](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI#i-create-aws-account)
  - [Get AWS Access Key Pair](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI#ii-get-aws-access-key-pair)
- Google Cloud Platform
  - [Create Google Cloud Account](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI#iii-create-google-cloud-account)
  - [Get Google Cloud Key Pair](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI#iv-get-google-cloud-key-pair)

### I. Create AWS Account

1. Go [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
2. Create a new AWS account ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/aws1.png)

4. Input the account information ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/aws3.png)
5. And finally the payment information ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/aws4.png)


### II. Get AWS Access Key Pair

1. Go to My Security Credentials ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/aws5.png)
2. Click on Create New Access Key and your key pair will be created ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/aws6.png)
3. This is the last chance you can record Secret Access Key. Either download to save it or record it somewhere ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/aws7.png)

### III. Create Google Cloud Account 

1. Go [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in Google using any email, click Getting Started ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp1.jpg)
3. Agree and Continue ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp2.jpg)
4. Launch a NEW PROJECT ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp3.jpg)
5. Set a Project name. NO ORGANIZATION if using personal email, and the organization is automatically specified if using institution email ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp4.jpg) 
6. Project created. Go IAM&Admin ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp5.jpg)
7. Service Accounts, CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp6.jpg)
8. Create service account ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp7.jpg)
9. Get a key pair (See IV. Get Google Cloud Key Pair) ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp8.jpg)
10. Navigate to any computing resource, which requires signing up a billing account ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp9.jpg)
11. Input payment information ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp10.jpg)
12. Personal information and finish ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp11.jpg)

### IV. Get Google Cloud Key Pair

1. Switch to a project ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp14.png)
2. Add service account ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp15.png)
3. Create account ![image](https://github.com/BioDepot/serverless-UMI/raw/master/img/gcp16.png)
