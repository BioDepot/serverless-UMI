# Rapid RNA sequencing data analysis using serverless computing

This document summarizes steps (with detailed screenshots) required to manually set up the RNA-seq serverless pipeline on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Following these steps for the first time could take a couple of hours even for a technical user. Our graphical frontend using the BioDepot-workflow-builder (Bwb) allows users to skip most of these steps, thus enhances the accessibility of the latest cloud computing platforms for biomedical scientists.
